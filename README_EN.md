# MARKDOWN.HTML

> [简体中文](README.md) | English

This project aims to provide a low-dependency, simple deployment solution for rendering Markdown web pages.

## Features

- **Low dependencies**: Only an HTML file, a small number of CDNs, and server programs are required to complete Markdown pages rendering.
- **Multilingual support**: Supports machine translation between multiple languages.
- **Dark mode support**: Supports light, dark, and system-following modes.
- **Pjax support**: Supports page navigation without refreshing the whole page.

## Usage

1. Download and rename the `index.html` file from this repository and place to your website's root directory or any other directory;
2. When the html file is accessed, it will automatically render the `index.md` in the same directory. If `index.md` does not exist, it will render `README.md`.
